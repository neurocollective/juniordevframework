Hello! Here's a list of resources to help you learn frameworks/dependencies used in this project.

Docker allows all of our code, including all dependencies, to be 'containerized'. This makes sure that the code has everything it needs to run, and can run in it's own little bubble like a Virtual Machine (but without the overhead.)
