# The Product Vision

What are the right things you should be doing as you search? The framework will be opinionated, prompting you to do the things that are most likely to keep your search moving towards employment.

What are those things?

- Work on some kind of porfolio project or open source repo
- Email people working in software, and ask for their advice (virtual coffee chats)
- Follow up with those you have contacted previously, and gently showcase some of the way you continue to grow
- Follow up by email to real person after every application

The juniordevframework will be a dashboard where you can track your job search. But who can keep up with typing in every little thing you do, as you do it? Automation will take care of that problem.

- The framework can read your email, to track your applications (just make sure to be signed in to indeed/monster/linkedin as you apply)
- Follow up emails can be sent automtically after an application is detected. Destination email addresses can be guessed by entering one or two company contact names.
- The framework can generate cover letters for you, posting in company name & title
- The framework can have different resume variations ready to go

This vision is NOT written in stone. If you have feedback or suggestions on how to improve the vision, open an issue!
